# Name: Mackenzie Bishop
## Favorite place to buy food: Casa Grande
Casa Grande is a Mexican restaurant in my home town. It's located off of our town square and is a family-owned business. Next door to it is the **Jackson Cafe**, which houses apartments above a small cafe that is one of the main hangout spots in town. On the other side, a German bistro, **Beethoven's**, is one of the oldest restaurants the town has.
