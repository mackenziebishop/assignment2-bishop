# Mackenzie Bishop
I'm currently a junior working on my BS in Computer Science at Northwest Missouri State University. On campus, I have worked as a Resident Assistant in Residential Life for 2 years. A fun fact about myself is that I have traveled to Italy, Switzerland, and France. My most prized posession is an original release from 1977 of Fleetwood Mac's _Rumors_ album on vinyl.
